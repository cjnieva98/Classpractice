            "On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so
            beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, 
            that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame
            belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as
            saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy 
            to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing 
            prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every 
            pain avoided.
