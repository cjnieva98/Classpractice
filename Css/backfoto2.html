            our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain 
            avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations 
            of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances 
            accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection
            he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid 
            worse pains."
            On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so
            eguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, 
            that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame 
            belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as 
            saying through shrinking from toil and pain
